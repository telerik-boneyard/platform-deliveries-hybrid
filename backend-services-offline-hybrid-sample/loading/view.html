        <p>The server-side data for this sample app has not been initialized. We can initialize it automatically, but we need your master key. Please enter it in the config.js file in the root folder of the project.</p>
        <p>You can find your master key in your app's Settings tab in the Telerik Platform Portal. Once you have provided your master key, just build and run this app again.</p>
        <p><br /><br /><strong>WARNING</strong><br /> You should never include your master key in the code of your app. Someone could reverse-engineer it and get full access to your server-side data.</p>
